# robot-simulator
Robot Simulator is a Java Swing GUI tool that I had created as part of my User Interface Design course at University of Texas at Dallas.
This tool contains controls that will help the user to control the movement of the robot and show the movement, position and speed of the robot on the tool screen.
It also contains controls to move the arm of the robot. The arm movement too is shown on the screen of the tool.
